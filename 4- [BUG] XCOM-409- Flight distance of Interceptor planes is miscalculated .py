[BUG] XCOM-409: Flight distance of Interceptor planes is miscalculated
Type: Bug ðŸª³
Priority: Major
Component: Operational Logistics Software
Reporter: maverick
Assignee: Assigned to you

Bug Description
Pilots have reported discrepancies in their flight logs after returning from interception missions. The travel distance logged in the logistics software does not match actual flight paths, potentially leading to incorrect fuel calculations and errors in planning of future missions.

Steps to Reproduce
Deploy an interceptor to engage a UFO.
Upon its return, note the average speed (given in knots) and travel time (in minutes) reported by onboard instruments.
Enter the values into the Logistics and Planning System.
Expected result: The system should correctly compute the distance in kilometers.
Actual result: The logged distance appears inaccurate.
Impact
If not fixed, this could cause interceptors to run out of fuel mid-mission, leaving Earth vulnerable to alien attacks. On the other hand, if the system overestimates travel distance, interceptors may be overfueled, making them heavier than necessary. This reduces maneuverability, increases takeoff time, and could put pilots at a disadvantage during high-speed engagements with alien craft.

The Flight Operations team has requested an immediate fix.

Task
Investigate and fix the bug in the travel distance calculation function.




Test Cases:

@test.describe("Example tests")
def example_tests():

    @test.it("Edge case - no departure")
    def test_edge_case_no_departure():
        test.assert_equals(travel_distance(0, 0), 0)

    @test.it("In one hour of sub-sonic flight at 600 knots should travel ~1111.2 km")
    def test_sub_sonic_flight():
        test.assert_approx_equals(travel_distance(600, 60), 1111.2, 1e-3)

    @test.it("In one hour of super-sonic flight at 800 knots should travel ~1481.6 km")
    def test_super_sonic_flight():
        test.assert_approx_equals(travel_distance(800, 60), 1481.6, 1e-3)



Solution:
# speed of aircrafts is given in *knots*
# travelTime is in *minutes*
# travel distance should be returned in *kilometers*'


'''
def travel_distance(avg_speed, travel_time):
    KM_PER_MILE = 1.852
    travel_hours = travel_time / 60  # Convert minutes to hours
    travel_miles = avg_speed * travel_hours  # Distance in miles
    travel_kms = travel_miles * KM_PER_MILE  # Convert miles to kilometers
    return travel_kms
